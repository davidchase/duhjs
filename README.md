Straightforward Style Guide for Javascript.

Why?
---
Yes everyone and their neighbor has one, so why not another one.

Preface
-------
These are my ideas that I use to code with `if you don't like it don't use it.`

Simple as that.

Variables
---------
```js
// one var per line
var foo;
var bar = 0;
var foobar = 'some string';
```

Easy to read, don't care about saving a few keys.

Functions
---------
```js
// I prefer function expressions
// delcare my functions before I use them.

// first create
var foo = function(){};
var baz = function(){};

// then use :)
foo();
baz();

```
